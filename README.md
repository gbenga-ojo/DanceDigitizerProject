This is the frontend code for the dance digitizer app.

It uses react native with expo.

**To run: (1) Make sure your computer has Node installed - download from internet if necessary. (2) Download the expo go app on your phone. (3) In terminal, cd to the the dDigit folder. (4) In terminal, enter command: npx expo start. (5) Follow instructions it gives (scan the qr code).**

for frontend, run npm install and then npm start, you'll need to add an mp4 file inside of the assets folder called sample3.mp4 and then for now change all the paths where the video path is used to where yours is

for backend, you'll need to install flask, librosa, moviepy, shutil, ffmeg and whatever else it might say
